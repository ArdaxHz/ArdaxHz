[Prayer Times Wallpaper](https://github.com/ArdaxHz/prayer-times-wallpaper)

#### Mac Task Scheduler
Ever wanted to schedule tasks to run at certain times, but didn't know how, and the Mac method looked complicated? Look no further, for Mac Task Scheduler does it all for you (except the actual scripts). It's designed to work like the Windows Task Scheduler, making it easier to view, create, and edit tasks that run across your whole Mac.

### Learning:
GoLang
The DevOps [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops)

### Who Am I?
I'm Ardax, building things and possibly vibing, to improve my engineering skills. Learning and researching more on infra, pipelines, and AI/ML.
